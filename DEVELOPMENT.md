# Development

---
- **4/18/20** Set up final project through repo provided
   - Still need to figure out how to move shapes (looking into OpenGL)

- **4/19/20** Worked on moving the backboard/hoop across the screen. Need to:
   - [ ] Add background and make board visible
   - [ ] Detect mouse input
   
- **4/20/20** Added the ball that the user will control and completed the following:
   - [x] Add background
   - [x] Detected mouse input and calculated an approximate linear path
   
- **4/21/20** Added functionality to control the ball with the space key
     - Register score if ball collides with the hoop
     
- **4/26/20** Worked on decomposition of function into different classes
     -Created board/ball classes

- **4/27/20** Added speed feature which makes the board move faster as score increases. Need to:  
    - [ ] Work on mouse-click
    - [ ] Fix score detection
    
- **4/28/20** Added speed feature which makes the board move faster as score increases. Need to:  
    - [x] Move ball in direction of mouse click
    - [x] Fix score detection (not hardcoded)

- **5/03/20** Fixed issue with score moving and added GUI to let user know lives remaining. Need to:
    - [ ] Make functions more modular
    - [ ] Prevent repeated work in functions 

- **5/04/20** Updated functions to prevent repeated work and made them more modular. Cleaned up code and added documentation.
     - [x] Make functions more modular
     - [x] Prevent repeated work in functions, simplified calculations
     - Added game title
     - Wrote README

- **5/05/20** Made DrawBall function constant so it only draws, added function to take care of handling updating position

- **5/06/20** Cleaned up code and global variables to make class specific.
